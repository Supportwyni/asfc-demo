The purpose of this Bulletin is to outline the key changes in the EI 1581 6th edition and to inform operating locations of \nany actions required. \nKey changes in EI 1581 6th edition \nThe key changes in the 6th edition of EI 1581 include: \n- a new low dirt/low water type (type S-M) intended for mobile applications. The new S-M type is a combination of the former\ntype S-LD and S-LW. All EI 1581 5th edition type S-LW systems are automatically qualified to 1581 6th edition type S-M, at the\nexisting tested flowrate.\n- 50 mm (2inch) and 100 mm (4 inch) nominal diameter coalescer and separator elements are now included within the scope.\nThese are not intended to retrofit into vessels with existing 5th edition qualified 150mm (6 inch) filter elements.\n- element lengths for 50 mm (2 inch) nominal diameter coalescer and separator elements are standardized.\n- 50 mm (2 inch) nominal diameter elements shall have a defined threaded base design, to avoid their misuse as filter", "source": "Bulletin-102-EI1581-6th-Edition-Filter-Water-Separators-with-attachment-Apr-2017.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "1", "chunk_length": 1395}}
