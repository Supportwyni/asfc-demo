JIG's Core Principles 4.02 and a previously \nissued Bulletin 28 already give guidance to operators on how to devise a Business Continuity \nPlan and a Pandemic Response Plan. The current pandemic may be the first time many of these \nplans have been really tested. \n \nRecommendations and Good Practice \nThe JIG Common Processes Committee with support from the JIG HSSE Committee has \ntherefore put together a document containing a list of questions to help operators evaluate \ntheir readiness for the potential impact of COVID-19. The list can also be used as a source of \nGood Practice to be adopted by operators where appropriate. Operators should read the \ndocument, evaluate their readiness and make any changes to current procedures if appropriate \n(following their own internal rules for procedure modification). \nHyperlink to document: COVID-19 Advice \n \nActions to implement this Bulletin: \n \n \nAction Description \n \nAction Type \nTarget \nCompletion \nDate \nRead the attached document to evaluate your organisations", "source": "Bulletin-127-Crisis-Business Continuity Plans.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "1", "chunk_length": 1399}}
