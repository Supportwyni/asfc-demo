Due to the requirements of DEF STAN 91-091/14, conductivity limits are mandatory for product to meet this \nspecification. However, it is acknowledged that in some manufacturing and distribution systems it is more \npractical to inject SDA further downstream. In such cases, the Certificate of Quality for the batch should be \nannotated thus: \"Product meets the requirements of Defence Standard 91-091/14 except for electrical \nconductivity\". In some situations, the conductivity can decrease rapidly, and the fuel can fail to respond to \nadditional dosing with Static Dissipator Additive(s). In such cases, fuel may be released with conductivity down \nto a minimum of 25pS/m provided that the fuel is fully tested against the specification and the Tank Release \nNote is annotated with the explanation \"Product released below 50pS/m due to conductivity loss as per Annex \nF of DEFSTAN 91-091/14\". \n21.

The requirement to determine lubricity applies only to fuels \nwhose composition is made up of a) at least 20% of severely hydroprocessed components and less than 5% \nnon-hydroprocessed components or b) includes synthetic fuel components. The limit applies only at the point \nof manufacture. For important advisory information on the lubricity of aviation turbine fuels see Annex F of DEF \nSTAN 91-091/14. LIA additive (also known as LIA) may be used to improve lubricity; only those additives listed \nin Table 2 of ASTM D1655 / Annex A of DEF STAN 91-091/14 are permitted (note that the list of approved LIAs \nhas been revised and reduced with the change to Def Stan 91-091 Issue 14). Refer also to Appendix A.5 of DEF \nSTAN 91-091/14 for advice on point of addition. When injecting LIA downstream of point of manufacture, care \nshall be taken to ensure that maximum dose rates are not exceeded. \n22.

Concentrations of Fuel System Icing Inhibitor (FSII) less than 0.02% by volume may be considered negligible \nand do not require agreement/notification.
