This note summarises the issues and highlights where \nextra attention is required to manage the increased risk. \n \nIt is now common (especially in Europe) for national governments to mandate the \nuse of renewable components in automotive fuels. One of the most common options \nis to blend Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (FAME) into diesel to produce what is often called \n'biodiesel'. Biodiesel is designated B5 when it contains 5% FAME. Pure FAME is \noften designated B100. \n \nThere are two main issues with introduction of FAME into diesel fuel that impact on \njet fuel: \n \n1) FAME is surface active and tends to stick to metal or glass surfaces. This \ncreates new risks for cross contamination where supply chains handle both jet \nfuel and biodiesel. \n \n2) FAME is a non-hydrocarbon fuel component. The jet fuel specification states \nexplicitly that only hydrocarbon components or approved additives are \nallowed. \n \nThe international jet fuel specifications", "source": "Bulletin-21-FAME-briefing-note-Nov08.pdf-Public.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "1", "chunk_length": 1399}}

Levels above 5 mg/kg, render the fuel \noff-specification. \n \nThis is a serious issue because there have been recent instances in which jet fuel \ncontaining above 5ppm FAME has, inadvertently, been supplied to the airport.", "source": "Bulletin-21-FAME-briefing-note-Nov08.pdf-Public.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "1", "chunk_length": 493}}

Attention should be focused (but not limited to) the \nfollowing areas: \n \n* In multiproduct pipelines, pipewall effects can be mitigated with the use of \nintermediate buffers (see JIG Bulletin 15 at www.jointinspectiongroup.org). \nHowever, there is also the risk of trace biodiesel contamination in manifolds, \npumps etc (see JIG Bulletin 16 at www.jointinspectiongroup.org). \n \n* For ships and barges, care must be taken with tank cleaning and flushing \nand draining common lines including sea or jetty loading lines. Experience \nhas shown that switching from a B5 to jet fuel requires at least a hot water \ntank wash (but preferably also an intermediate FAME-free cargo) to remove \nFAME residue. Switching from neat FAME to jet fuel requires particular care \nand some advocate at least 3 intermediate (zero-FAME) cargoes plus the hot \nwater wash before loading jet fuel. \n \n* Active tank cleaning rather than simple draining is required for road tankers \nand rail tank cars when switching between biodiesel and jet fuel.
