The availability of drop-in solutions was identified as the \nfastest way to eliminate SAP-based filtration from all aviation fuel handling applications for the reasons explained \nin JIG Bulletin 105 and the documents referenced therein. \nIt should be noted that the mitigating actions set out in JIG Bulletin 105 (Actions to mitigate SAP migration) when \nfollowed by Operators do not completely eliminate the risk of SAP migration. As the SIG's work demonstrated, \nsome migration could take place even when fuelling using SAP FMs at low differential pressures. This is why JIG \nBulletin 105 sets out the industry's agreed roadmap towards phase-out of FMs. \nA joint industry programme designed and funded by JIG, IATA and A4A - the Joint Industry Filtration Field Trial \nGroup - has been working since 2018 to conduct field evaluation of new Energy Institute qualified or evaluated (as \napplicable) filtration/sensing technology being presented for adoption into the", "source": "Bulletin-132-Withdrawal of Filter Monitors_1588.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "2", "chunk_length": 1390}}

This is why the Joint Industry Filtration Field Trial Group has since 2017 focussed on realising \nthe industry roadmap for transitioning to non-SAP-based filtration technologies. \nThe JIG Standards have at all times emphasised that it is the responsibility of each Operator to determine which of \nthe available technologies is appropriate for its locations and circumstances and to conduct any Risk, process and \nreliability assessments as may be appropriate, and that JIG does not make Operator-specific recommendations for \nparticular technologies; the responsibility for deciding upon which technology is appropriate remains with the \nOperator.
