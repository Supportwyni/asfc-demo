The Checklist is \nnot a specification and manufacturing, and supply locations shall not release fuel only to the Checklist. \nIf reference to the Checklist is to be made, the following statement should be used if the fuel meets the \nrequirements of this Bulletin. \n \n\"It is certified that the samples have been tested", "source": "Bulletin-156-AFQRJOS-Checklist-Issue-36-FINAL.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "1", "chunk_length": 1396}}
