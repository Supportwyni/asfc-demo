The Notes \nhighlight some of the main issues concerning the specification parameters. \n \nConformance to AFQRJOS requires conformance to the detail of both specifications listed above, not \njust the following table. See Note 23 for guidance on statements declaring conformance to these \nspecifications. If necessary, airports operated to JIG Standards can supply jet fuel to either of the \nparent specifications listed above provided the participants agree. \n \nAlso, it should be specifically noted that DEF STAN 91-91/7 Amendment 2 requires traceability of \nproduct to point of manufacture and requirements applicable to fuels containing synthetic or \nrenewable components.

This does not permit the continuous addition of FSII at these low \nconcentrations.
