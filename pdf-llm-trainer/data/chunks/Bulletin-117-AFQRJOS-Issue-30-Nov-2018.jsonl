Due to the requirements of DEF STAN 91-091/10, conductivity limits are mandatory for product to \nmeet this specification. However, it is acknowledged that in some manufacturing and distribution \nsystems it is more practical to inject SDA further downstream. In such cases, the Certificate of \nQuality for the batch should be annotated thus: \"Product meets the requirements of AFQRJOS \nCheck List 30 except for electrical conductivity\". In some situations, the conductivity can decrease \nrapidly and the fuel can fail to respond to additional dosing with Static Dissipator Additive(s). In such \ncases, fuel may be released with conductivity down to a minimum of 25pS/m provided that the fuel \nis fully tested against the specification and the Tank Release Note is annotated with the explanation \n\"Product released below 50pS/m due to conductivity loss as per Annex F of DEFSTAN 91-091/10\". \n20.
