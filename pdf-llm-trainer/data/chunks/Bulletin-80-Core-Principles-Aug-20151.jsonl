Related confidentiality \nagreements are maintained between the key parties to manage this process. \n \n 'Core Principles'1 apply to on-airport incorporated JVs and unincorporated \nJVs where the JV provides services to two or more marketers of aviation fuel. \n \n'Core Principles - Throughput Locations'2 apply to on-airport 'Throughput \nLocations' where the operator provides a service for two or more marketers of \naviation fuel. The operator may be one of the marketers or an Independent \nThird Party Operator (ITPO). \nCore Principles do not apply to pre-airport locations, or on-airport solus locations \n(where there are no throughputters) or on-airport Marketing/Commercial JVs that \nmarket in their own name and do not share operational services with any other \nmarketers. However, these activities still need to comply with general competition law", "source": "Bulletin-80-Core-Principles-Aug-20151.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "1", "chunk_length": 1394}}
