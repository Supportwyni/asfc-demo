Parties to Core Principles are reminded of the requirements of Clause 2 (d) for\nsegregation of duties for JV Representatives and the need for agreement of other Participants where this is not\npossible. Parties to Core Principles are responsible for ensuring this requirement is met.\n2.

Clarification of the use of the term 'Participant'\nNo change is required to the Core Principles documents. Core Principles Clause 1 (a) uses the long-used,\nstandard legal definition of Participants. The term Participants should only be used for parties that are\nshareholders in incorporated JVs or participants in unincorporated JVs. Throughputters are not Participants but\nare included in the Core Principles within the definition of Users.\nThe CP Committee also reconfirmed: \n1. To continue to provide training materials for JV Representatives including training materials for Core Principles\ntraining materials,\n2. The annual Core Principles refresher training and completion of annual compliance audit (preferably on the JIG\nDashboard) should continue and\n3.
