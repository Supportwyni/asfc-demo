The cotter pin functionally prevents the castle \nnut from inadvertently unthreading from the crank pin screw. \n \nRelated Issue Cotter pin (P/N GF24665-1013): \nWe were recently made aware of multiple crank pin failures at various sites due to inadvertent cotter pin dislodgement. Without \na cotter pin to properly secure the crank pin and castle nut it is possible for the poppet linkage to become detached. This can \nlead to fuel spills when the nozzle is disconnected from the aircraft. We believe it is possible for the cotter pin to become \ndislodged if installed incorrectly. If the cotter pin is improperly installed it may contact the nozzle body during the process of \nrotating the crank handle. As the crank assembly rotates around the nozzle body housing it may bind against the crank support \nstructure or the casted support rib (Figure 1).

If it is \ndifficult to view the cotter pin from the inlet side you may open the nozzle poppet and view the cotter pin from the outlet end of \nthe nozzle using a nozzle opening tool. It is important to ensure all pressure has been relieved prior to inspection. \nEnsure the cotter pin and castle nut are properly attached to the crank pin. The assembly should look like figure 2. If any of the \nitems are damaged or missing the nozzle should be taken out of service and repaired. \n \n \nFigure 2 Crank Assembly \nEnsure the cotter pin does not contact the nozzle body or the support rib.
