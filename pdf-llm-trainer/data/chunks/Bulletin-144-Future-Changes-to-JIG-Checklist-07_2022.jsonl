Furthermore, we are aware that the existence of the \nChecklist leads some operators to incorrectly certify and release fuel only against the physical \ncharacteristics of Checklist Table 1, thereby overlooking the other important requirements that are listed \nin the other clauses of the Specifications. \nIn addition, the manufacturing, handling and composition requirements of Jet Fuel will become \nprogressively more complex as synthetic fuels and components enter the supply chain. These \nrequirements cannot be adequately covered by a document such as the Checklist. \nThe simplification of the Checklist is intended to enable operators to quickly identify the differences \nbetween the two main Specifications, whilst", "source": "Bulletin-144-Future-Changes-to-JIG-Checklist-07_2022.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "1", "chunk_length": 1395}}

In such cases, the Certificate of Quality for the batch should be annotated thus: \"Product meets the \nrequirements of DEF STAN 91-091 Issue 14 except for electrical conductivity\". In some situations, the conductivity can \ndecrease rapidly, and the fuel can fail to respond to additional dosing with Static Dissipator Additive(s). In such cases, \nfuel may be released with conductivity down to a minimum of 25pS/m provided that the fuel is fully tested against the \nspecification and the Tank Release Note is annotated with the explanation \"Product released below 50pS/m due to \nconductivity loss as per Annex F of DEF STAN 91-091 Issue 14\". \n \n12. This requirement comes from DEF STAN 91-091 Issue 14.
