Endorsed by IATA, it complements their publication: \nGuidance Material on Microbiological Contamination in Aircraft Fuel Tanks. \nAlthough IATA recommends maximum allowable levels of microbial contamination in aircraft fuel tanks, there are no \nindustry specified microbiological contamination limits for the manufacture or distribution of aviation fuels up to point \nof delivery to aircraft due to the wide variety of facilities involved and the extremely dynamic nature of the distribution \nsystem. Guidance provided in this JIG Information Document is intended to ensure microbe levels at the point of \ndelivery to aircraft are significantly lower than the IATA recommended maximum levels for aircraft fuel tanks. \nThe following content areas are included in this three part document. \nPart 1: Microbial Monitoring Strategies \n \nIntroduction and background on the subject of microbial contamination \n \nGuidance on appropriate sampling and monitoring strategies for use throughout the aviation fuel supply \nchain up to the point of delivery to aircraft", "source": "Bulletin-83-Microbial-Monitoring-Strategies-Oct-2015.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "1", "chunk_length": 1399}}
