Also, at low flow \nrates, water can be poorly distributed in FM vessels with the possibility of localised Super \nAbsorbent Polymer (SAP) activation resulting in the threat of water transmission and SAP \nmigration. Appropriate sizing is not always easy to achieve when the same vessels are \nrequired for different applications that demand different flow rates. There are several \nconsiderations to enable this flexibility without compromising the performance of the filter \nvessel. \n \n \nFilter Monitor Flow Rates \n \nFuelling equipment shall be operated to ensure that FMs are regularly used above 50% of \ntheir qualified rated flow and that this condition is met at least weekly.

The blanks may take \nthe form of dummy elements that will not allow flow or fixed inserts/plates fitted to the \nelement mounting orifices. Careful consideration should be given to the selection of positions \nto blank off in order to ensure the fuel flow in the vessel is evenly distributed. \n \n \nDifferential Pressure (dP) monitoring \n \nThe monitoring of the differential pressure (pressure change across a filter vessel) and dP \ncorrection is particularly important to ensure the filter does not exceed its recommended \nchange-out pressure. FM failure in the form of Super Absorbent Polymer (SAP) migration \nmay result if monitors are subjected to prolonged elevated differential pressures (above the \nmaximum change-out dP). dP is a function of flow rate and will change according to the \noperational flow rates in a vessel. \n \nIt is also important to recognise that if a sudden drop in dP is observed during operation, \nwithout any obvious cause being found, especially for the same flow rate conditions, the \noperation shall be stopped and the elements changed. \n \n \n \n \nPage 1 of 2", "source": "Bulletin-52-Filter-Monitor-Vessels-Flow-Rates-and-dP-Monitoring-Jun-20124.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "1", "chunk_length": 1115}}
