The defect is affecting gaskets \nattached to open-ended filter elements, resulting in distortion of the gasket after contact with fuel. The Product Safety \nAwareness Bulletin indicated that this issue affected some elements manufactured between 1st January and 20th June \n2025, see list of affected elements below in Table 1. \nExample of gasket distortion: \n \nParker Velcon has provided the following photos to distinguish the difference between a defective gasket and a gasket \nthat is \"fit for purpose\", so that Users can assess all elements before installation. The \"ACCEPTABLE\" gaskets (\"fit for \npurpose\") will have a smooth surface finish and sharp cut edges. The \"NOT ACCEPTABLE\" gaskets will have a rough \nsurface texture like leather. The edges are not as sharp but appear to be slightly irregular. \n \nACCEPTABLE \nNOT \nACCEPTABLE", "source": "Bulletin-158-PARKER-VELCON-Filtration-Safety-Awareness-FINAL.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "1", "chunk_length": 1285}}
