Some examples of relevant aviation fuelling equipment and materials specifications are: \n \n \nEI 1581 Specification and qualification procedures for aviation jet fuel filter/separators \n \nSAE AS 5877 Detailed Specification for Aircraft Pressure Refuelling Nozzles \n \nUK Ministry of Defence Standard 80-97 Issue 5 Paint, System, for the interior of Bulk Fuel Tanks and Fittings, \nMulti-Pack \n \nThese specifications contain a detailed list of exacting performance, material compatibility and mechanical requirements \nthat need to be met through first-article (prototype) testing under controlled laboratory/test rig conditions. This testing \nis carried out by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and may be contracted out to an independent testing \nhouse / laboratory in part or sometimes in its entirety.

All of the testing is recorded with relevant evidence such as \nlaboratory analytical test results, instrument readings and measurements. This data is compiled into a Qualification Test \nreport. \n \nIn some cases the qualification testing, or at least key parts of it, are carried out under the observation of an expert \nwitness or witnesses. Witnesses may be potential purchasers of the equipment or an individual acting on behalf of the \nowner of the Specification. For example, the Energy Institute provides expert witnesses to observe the qualification of \naviation filters that are being tested against the exacting requirements of their filtration specifications (EI 1581, EI 1583 \nand EI 1590). The Test Reports are then reviewed by the EI Aviation Fuel Filtration Committee to confirm that the \ntesting was complete, in accordance with the relevant specification and that the results met the specification \nrequirements. The EI Equipment Sub-Committee can provide a similar role for relevant equipment qualifications. \n \nThe Qualification Test Report provides evidence that a material or item of equipment does indeed meet all of the \nrequirements of the specification.
