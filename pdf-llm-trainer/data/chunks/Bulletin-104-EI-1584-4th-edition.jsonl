The publication also specifies requirements that need to be met to achieve universal \ninterchangeability between components of various manufacturers and requirements for optional features which component \nmanufacturers may be requested by users to provide. \nChanges in the 4th edition \nThe main revisions incorporated in the 4th Edition of EI 1584 include: \n* \nProviding greater emphasis on the need for universal interchangeability between hydrant pit valve and hydrant pit coupler \ncombinations between any manufacturers. \n* \nIncluding the requirement for the hydrant pit valve manufacturer to provide detailed instructions for the mounting of the \nvalve arrangement to hydrant riser flanges. \n* \nSpecifying the maximum permissible wear measured across any point on the diameter of the hydrant pit valve", "source": "Bulletin-104-EI-1584-4th-edition.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "1", "chunk_length": 1392}}
