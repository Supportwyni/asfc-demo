The following issues have been \nidentified on fuelling vehicles with FWS: \n* The sump drain was not connected to the visi-jar for after fuelling sampling. \n* The inlet side of the FWS, instead of the FWS sump, was connected to the visi-jar for after fuelling sampling \n* The sampling points were incorrectly labelled, e.g. the piping connection from the downstream filter side \nwas labelled as \"After fuelling sample\" and vice versa. \nThe issues described above were not associated with a specific vehicle manufacturer or a specific region, \ninstead it appears these issues are widespread. \nInto-plane fuelling companies shall verify that filter sampling connections on their fuelling vehicles are \nconsistent with the type of filter", "source": "Bulletin-107-Filter-Sampling-point-issues2.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "1", "chunk_length": 1399}}
