In most of these incidents, the coupler was struck by vehicles during \nfuel flow for aircraft fuelling resulting in spillage and in some cases fuel release under pressure \n(forming a geyser such as the one shown below) with spillage of a few thousand litres. \n \nAlthough the detailed incident investigation for these incidents is not known to JIG, it appears \nthat the incidents can be attributed to a range of different root causes, including human error \n(distraction, inattention), lack of training and lack of adherence to procedures. \nWhat appears to be a common characteristic in all of these recent incidents is that the hydrant \npit couplers and valves did comply with EI 1584 3rd/4th edition but were not of dual air/lanyard \npilot design. The hydrant pit valves were fitted with a lanyard only. \nBased on information provided to JIG, it appears that in a number of these incidents, the spillage", "source": "Bulletin-126-Dual-Air-Lanyard-Pilots.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "1", "chunk_length": 1391}}

Because of its design, a hydrant pit valve operated by a dual air / lanyard \ndevice will close quickly when the deadman is released. \nJIG standards currently mandate dual air / lanyard devices for new hydrants and recommend \nthat they are also installed on existing systems. Dual air lanyard devices are available from all \nhydrant pit valve OEMs and have been in service at many locations for a long period of time. \nDual air / lanyard devices offer a number of advantages over lanyard only as follows: \n* The pilot operated valve will close under spring pressure in the case of a pneumatic line \nrupture. A pneumatic line rupture may be caused, for example, by fire or impact from \nanother vehicle on the hydrant pit valve / coupler assembly. \n* The pilot operated valve will close if the deadman is released. \n* The pilot operated valve can be more easily operated and closed repeatedly at a remote \ndistance from the hydrant pit. This may be a particular advantage when the fueling \noperator is performing additional services during the aircraft fuelling. \n* Dual air /lanyard operation affords a dual closure.

This may be a particular advantage when the fueling \noperator is performing additional services during the aircraft fuelling. \n* Dual air /lanyard operation affords a dual closure. When the air pressure is released, the \npilot operated valve closes and remains closed and the subsequent disconnection and \nremoval of the pit coupler closes the pit valve outlet adapter poppet. With a lanyard \nonly device, unless the lanyard is pulled during the disconnection process, the pilot \noperated valve will not close resulting in a pressurized hydrant pit valve (hot hydrant) \ncondition. \n \nCase for action \nThe JIG Operations Committee with support from the JIG Council have therefore unanimously \nagreed to mandate in the next revision of JIG standards (issue 13 - planned for Q1-2021), that \ndual air/lanyard operated pilots are fitted on all hydrant pit valves.
