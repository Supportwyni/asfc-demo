Members of the shareholding companies visited the site to review the \nincident. The equipment distributor has collected the damaged assembly for a detailed \nevaluation. \nAs part of the preliminary investigation, it has been revealed that two of the six carbon steel \nfasteners that secure the upper and lower half together failed resulting in a fracture of the pit \ncoupler upper half casting. These fasteners are the subject of the attached Service Bulletin. \nAs noted in the attached SB, Eaton decided to change the previously selected stainless-steel \nstud to a black oxide coated steel stud (P/N 221221), in order to improve field serviceability and \nrepair. \nAs noted by Eaton, a number of corrosion-related hydrogen embrittlement", "source": "Bulletin-119-Eaton-Carter-Hydrant-Pit-Coupler-Serious-Incident-12.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "1", "chunk_length": 1398}}

On 6th August 2018 Eaton \nannounced that they identified the suspect population of hydrant pit couplers with the affected \nstuds (P/N 221321) and provided inspection methods to determine if the affected studs were \nin use. \nDuring investigation of this latest incident it has also come to JIG's attention that Operators \nusing these pit couplers may not be aware of the Service Bulletin issued in 2018 and may not \nyet have checked their equipment. For this reason, we are alerting our Members of this latest \nincident and advising them what actions to take. \nCase for action \nJIG and the EI are working with Eaton in determining if additional course of actions is required \nto address the cause(s) of this problem and prevent similar serious incidents from re-occurring. \nA further bulletin may be issued in the future. \nIn the meantime, given the potential consequences of this design modification, all users shall \ncarry out the inspection described in the attached SB, as a matter of priority as soon as \npractically possible but in any case, by no later than 31st March 2019.
