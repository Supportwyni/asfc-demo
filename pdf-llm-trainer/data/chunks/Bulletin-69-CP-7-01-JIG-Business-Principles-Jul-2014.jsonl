JVs can now update their Common Process \nImplementation Plan for completion. \nThe Business Principles \nThe Business Principles cover five main areas:- \n HSSE - the JV's commitment to continuously improving its HSSE performance and \ncomplying with the JV's policies on HSSE, drugs and alcohol, \n JV Employees - the JV's commitment to how it treats its employees and how the JV \nexpects them to act on behalf of the JV, \n Business Relationships - the JV's commitment to building trust with", "source": "Bulletin-69-CP-7-01-JIG-Business-Principles-Jul-2014.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "1", "chunk_length": 1399}}

CP 7.01D Business Principles Manual - Review Form is provided for \nthis purpose (see Attachment 2). \n Where a JV (or JV operating company) does not already have its own set of \nbusiness principles and policies, it is recommended to use the CP 7.01A \nBusiness Principles Manual 'Word' document as a template. It is recognized \nthat a JV will need to adapt some of the business principles to suit local \nlegislative requirements and its own unique circumstances. Sections that are \nmost likely to require adaptation are highlighted in [square brackets]. Some of \nthe business principles, such as JV Core Principles, are recognized industry \nbest practice for JVs and throughput locations and should be adopted without \nchange.
