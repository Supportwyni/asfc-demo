The ultimate objective remains unchanged: to \neliminate SAP-based filtration from all aviation fuel handling applications for the reasons explained in JIG \nBulletin 105 and the documents referenced therein. \nA joint industry programme designed and funded by JIG, IATA and A4A - the Joint Industry Filtration Field \nTrial Group - was established in 2018 to conduct field evaluation of new filtration/sensing technology.

The review of the field \nevaluation results from the joint industry group has demonstrated that, in the environments in which these \nsystems were tested, they prevent dirt and free water from reaching the aircraft, are durable in mobile \napplications and have sufficient life for routine operations.
