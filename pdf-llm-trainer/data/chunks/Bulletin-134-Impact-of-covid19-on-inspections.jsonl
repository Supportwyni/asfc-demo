Accordingly, detailed below are some temporary changes to the JIG \nInspection Policy, allowing JIG Members further flexibility where necessary to facilitate the creation of a viable \ninspection schedule for 2021/22. \n \nBackground: \nOn the 16th March 2020 JIG issued a Newsflash which recognised the impact of Covid-19 and announced measures to \nprovide JIG Members with some flexibility in managing their scheduled inspection programmes for 2020. JIG has now \nconducted a further review of inspection requirements for participating companies considering the continuing challenges \npresented by Covid-19, and its considerable impact on inspection schedules, and is making the temporary changes \ndetailed below that will be reflected in the new schedule that JIG will be sending to Members. \n \nTemporary Policy Changes: \n1. Every effort shall be made to complete JIG inspections scheduled for 2020. Where this is not possible, inspections may be \ndeferred until 2021. \n2. Where 2021 physical inspections are not possible, a self-assessment with review by a qualified JIG Inspector shall be \nperformed.
