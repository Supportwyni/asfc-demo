The precautions outlined below are \napplicable to locations that supply only Jet Fuel, or only Avgas, in addition to those \nlocations which supply both grades. \n \nThis Bulletin is issued as an update to existing JIG requirements for overwing fuelling (JIG 1 - \nInto-Plane Fuelling Services, sections 3.1.8, 6.5.5 & Appendix A10 and JIG 4 - Smaller Airports, \nsections 7.1.6, 10.5.4 & Appendix A6) and is intended to reflect current industry best practice in \nthe prevention of misfuelling incidents. Misfuelling is the term used to describe when the \nincorrect grade of fuel is delivered to an aircraft. A misfuelling could result in an aircraft engine \nfailure and this could be catastrophic if it occurs during flight. It is essential that procedures are \nin place to prevent this possibility. \n \n \nSimilar Aircraft \n \nCertain aircraft are particularly vulnerable to misfuelling as they are similar looking but have \ndifferent fuel requirements. Some examples are: \n \nRequires Avgas \n \n \n \nRequires Jet Fuel \nBeechcraft Queen Air \nlooks like \nBeechcraft King Air \nCessna 404 Titan \n \nlooks like \nCessna 441 Conquest \nMirage \n \n \nlooks like", "source": "Bulletin-81-Prevention-of-MisFuelling-Aug-20151.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "1", "chunk_length": 1398}}
