The limit applies only at the point of \nmanufacture. For important advisory information on the lubricity of aviation turbine fuels see Annex F of DEF STAN 91-\n091/12. LIA additive (also known as LIA) may be used to improve lubricity; only those additives listed in Table 2 of ASTM \nD1655 / Annex A of DEF STAN 91-091/12 are permitted.
