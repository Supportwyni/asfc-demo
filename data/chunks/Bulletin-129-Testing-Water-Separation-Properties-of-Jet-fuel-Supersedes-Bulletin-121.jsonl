These can be present due to: \n* the intentional addition of permitted performance additive materials (such as lubricity \nimprovers, corrosion inhibitors, static dissipator additives (SDA)) \n* trace material from the crude oil \n* unintended incidental contamination which occurs during fuel distribution. \nNot all surfactants are a concern, but they need to be controlled in Jet fuel as their presence \nmay cause disarming of filtration systems which are designed to coalesce and remove water \nfrom onward transfer of the fuel. Surfactants can also act to disperse particles (or in extreme \ncases act as detergents to mobilise otherwise stable particles) which can result in fuel that is \ndifficult to settle or filter. \nWater separation testing of fuel is conducted for two main reasons with jet fuel: \n1. To limit, at the point of manufacture, the level of unintended surfactants which could \ncarry over from the crude (for this purpose the industry currently prefers ASTM D3948) \n2.

A high rating suggests a fuel free of \nharmful surfactants; a low rating indicates that harmful surfactants may be present. The reason \nthat two limits are specified is that the test method (ASTM D3948) is sensitive to the presence \nof Static Dissipator Additive (SDA), but the surfactant effects of this additive are not deemed \nas concern to operations as they have a negligible impact on both filtration efficiency and \nsettling. \nBoth primary specifications contain a statement indicating that results from MSEP (ASTM \nD3948) testing downstream of the point of manufacture are not to be used as the sole reason \nfor rejection of fuel, but they can indicate a mandatory need for further diligent investigation. \nThis statement is based on significant historical information", "source": "Bulletin-129-Testing-Water-Separation-Properties-of-Jet-fuel-Supersedes-Bulletin-121.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "4", "chunk_length": 1399}}
