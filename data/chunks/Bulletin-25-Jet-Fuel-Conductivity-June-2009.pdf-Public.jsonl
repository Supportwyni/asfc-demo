The \nrationale for increasing the conductivity by the addition of SDA is to speed up \nthe rate at which static charge can dissipate, thereby reducing the time for \nwhich a static hazard might exist. The only approved SDA is Stadis 450 \nproduced by Innospec. \n \n* The presence of SDA does not prevent the generation of static charge. \nBonding is essential when transferring jet fuel during activities such as \nsampling, loading or", "source": "Bulletin-25-Jet-Fuel-Conductivity-June-2009.pdf-Public.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "1", "chunk_length": 1396}}

The ASTM D \n1655 specification for Jet A-1 has no mandatory conductivity requirement. \n \n* It is a well-known phenomenon for conductivity to decrease as fuel moves \nthrough the supply chain and this can require re-doping between the refinery \nand the airport fuelling operation. The DEF STAN 91-91 and ASTM D 1655 \nspecifications acknowledge this by applying a 3 mg/L limit for Stadis 450 on \ninitial doping and a cumulative limit of 5 mg/L. The DEF STAN 91-91 \nspecification also recognizes that, because of losses in the distribution \nsystem, the refinery may not be the best place to inject Stadis 450.", "source": "Bulletin-25-Jet-Fuel-Conductivity-June-2009.pdf-Public.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "1", "chunk_length": 1195}}

In the supply chain, it is permitted \nto certify that 'product meets the requirements of the specification for all \nproperties except conductivity'. \n \n* At the skin of the aircraft, if the conductivity doesn't meet the requirement \ncited above at ambient temperature, a minimum limit of 25 pS/m can be \nadopted as a temporary measure, subject to user notification requirements, to \navoid supply disruption, provided that at the SDA injection point, the \nconductivity at ambient temperature was over 50 pS/m. This is known as the \nLow Conductivity Protocol and full details can be found in Defence Standard \n91-91 (latest edition). \n \nImpact of SDA on Water Separation (MSEP) \n \n* In addition to (sometimes unpredictable) changes in conductivity during \ndistribution, the other major problem is that Stadis 450 is a surfactant. As a \nresult, it can increase the pick-up and dispersion of dirt and water in the fuel, \nespecially if it is poorly mixed into the fuel.

All the \nevidence points to the fact that the MSEP test (D 3948) can be overly \nsensitive to Stadis 450 with some fuels. \n \n* Although the DEF STAN 91-91 specification sets MSEP limits at point of \nmanufacture only, and does not require testing in the distribution system, \nMSEP testing in the supply chain is quite common as a means of identifying \npotentially harmful surfactant contamination. In addition to the problems \nnoted above, interpretation of MSEP test results is complicated by the poor \nreproducibility of the MSEP test method itself.

The advantages of \nthis route are that refineries are often well equipped to inject additives and for \nsome supply chains no further dosing is required. However, this is not \nnecessarily best practice because transport modes from the refinery (such as \nmulti-product vessels and pipelines) can cause significant and unpredictable \nloss of conductivity. It is also worth noting that there is no requirement for a \ndefined conductivity level when handling jet fuel on multi-product ships or \npipelines. \n \n2) Initial injection of Stadis 450 should be done as close as possible to the \nairport, preferably into storage directly upstream of a dedicated supply route \nto the airport. Injection at the airport itself is an option, but only where the \ninstallation has capacity to deal with problems such as over-dosing or \nunresponsive jet fuel. Also, the options for blending and problem mitigation \nare usually limited at airports. Consequently, injection of Stadis 450 at \nairports should be limited to fine-tuning conductivity levels where necessary to \nmeet the specification limits. \n \n3) The optimum point for additive injection within a storage facility depends on \nthe specific local circumstances and the following principles are", "source": "Bulletin-25-Jet-Fuel-Conductivity-June-2009.pdf-Public.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "3", "chunk_length": 1396}}

Unless this is the case, it is better to wait until after the \nproduct has been settled and drained before injection.
