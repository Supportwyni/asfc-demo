Recent work, with technology based on scattered light detection, has \nresulted in the development of water sensors that may be used as an alternative to Chemical Water \nDetectors (CWD), as explained below. \nWhen inserted into fuel, these water sensors are capable of measuring free water levels both above and \nbelow the 30 ppm IATA Guidance Material limit for the free water content of aviation fuel. When fitted \ninto pipework, this technology has the advantage of continually analysing the free water content of the \nflowing fuel, rather than relying upon periodic representative samples, such as with the use of CWD. \nQuantitative electronic water sensors shall not be confused with qualitative electronic bulk water \ndetectors qualified against EI 1592[2], which detect \"bulk water\" or water slugs that have displaced fuel \nwithin a system. \nWater sensors qualified for use as an alternative to CWD \nOnly electronic water sensors that have been qualified against EI 1598 and have been subjected to \nperformance testing on a test rig and in-service field trials over a 12-month period, with supportive data", "source": "Bulletin-110-Use-of-Electronic-Water-Sensors.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "1", "chunk_length": 1398}}
