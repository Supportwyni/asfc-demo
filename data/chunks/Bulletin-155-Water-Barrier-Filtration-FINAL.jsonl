This defect, caused by improper application of the dye used \nin the black outer sleeve, allows some of the dye to be released shortly after contact with fuel resulting in a colour \nchange of the fuel (to a blue / grey colour). The Product Safety Awareness Bulletin indicated that this issue affected \nelements manufactured between July 1st and December 31st, 2023. \nSince issue of the Product Safety Bulletin, JIG has received a report of Jet fuel being affected after contact with Water \nBarrier Filter elements manufactured outside of the date range indicated above. This JIG bulletin is therefore applicable \nto ALL WATER BARRIER FILTER ELEMENTS, regardless of manufacturing date, manufacturer or model number (e.g. \nCDFX, FWB, etc.). \nWhere Water Barrier Filter elements cause any colour change of the fuel, the elements and the fuel are not \nacceptable for use", "source": "Bulletin-155-Water-Barrier-Filtration-FINAL.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "1", "chunk_length": 1399}}

Until further notice, Water Barrier Filters shall not be used in Avgas service (Already installed elements may \ncontinue in service). This temporary restriction is introduced because the testing protocol in Appendix 1 is \nunlikely to be effective in identifying any colour change compared to the normal fuel colour of Avgas. The \ntesting protocol is also not appropriate due to the different flammability and handling considerations of Avgas \ngrades. As a result, there is no meaningful way to assess the suitability of Water Barrier Filter elements for \nservice with Avgas. \n \nNote that items 3 and 4 above are intended to be temporary measures until such time that further information \nregarding quality assurance of elements is provided and a further Bulletin is issued by JIG. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMONITORING OF ISSUES WITH WATER BARRIER ELEMENTS. \nOperators shall notify JIG if any of the Water Barrier elements tested at their sites are affected by the issue described \nin this JIG Bulletin 155, by sending an email with details of the element batch, date of manufacturing, and if safe and \npossible, photos of the fuel colour change, for monitoring proposes.
