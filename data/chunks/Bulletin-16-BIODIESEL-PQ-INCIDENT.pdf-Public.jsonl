This caused only a minor disruption to fuelling activities at Birmingham \nairport thanks to the availability of unaffected product from a different supply route. The quarantine \nseverely disrupted supplies to other airports normally supplied from Kingsbury and significant volumes \nof jet fuel were downgraded. \n \nThe investigation of what happened at the Kingsbury supply terminal is complete and has shown the \npotential for problems arising from the co-transport of biodiesel and jet fuel in multiproduct pipelines. \nA summary of the investigation is attached to this bulletin\u0001\u0002\u0002\n \nJIG Bulletin 15 highlighted potential problems with bulk transport of jet fuel", "source": "Bulletin-16-BIODIESEL-PQ-INCIDENT.pdf-Public.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "1", "chunk_length": 1398}}

The aim of the visit was to identify the possible cause of the presence of FAME in the fuel. \nThe delivery of fuel to BP Kingsbury is the responsibility of British Pipeline Agency as operators of the \nUKOP pipeline.

The end result was unacceptably \nhigh levels of FAME in JET A-1 in BP storage. \n \nIf a JET A-1 parcel receipt of 6000m3 is contaminated by 1.7m3 of DIESEL containing 4.8% FAME \n(typical B5 grade) then the mixture will contain 14ppm FAME. The exact volume of cross \ncontaminating DIESEL is not known. This calculated result is consistent with the FAME content of the \nJET A-1 tested in BP JET A-1 tanks 5 (22ppm) and 3 (19ppm). \n \nRecommendations \n \nShort Term \n* \nBP requested BPA to introduce the following procedures to eliminate the immediate cause: \n1. Drain the distillate manifold before ingress of ALL JET A-1 parcels \n2. Use a 250m3 buffer to proceed the receipt of ALL JET A-1 parcels \n3. Use a 250m3 buffer to trail the receipt of ALL JET A-1 parcels \n \nMedium Term \n* \nBP requested BPA to conduct a root-cause analysis of this incident. \n* \nBP requested a review of all UK multi product operations in co-operation with pipeline \noperators, terminal operators and shipping. \n \nLong term \n* \nBP have requested BPA to identify modifications (procedural and engineering)", "source": "Bulletin-16-BIODIESEL-PQ-INCIDENT.pdf-Public.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "5", "chunk_length": 1397}}
