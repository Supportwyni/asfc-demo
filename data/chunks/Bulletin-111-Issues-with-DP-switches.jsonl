The system shall be fitted with a reset mechanism that is \nappropriately controlled by authorised personnel, e.g. a key operated device. \nJIG has been made aware of instances where the dP switch reset key was not being properly controlled, \nfor example the reset key was available to operators rather than controlled by supervisors. In addition, \nJIG is aware of instances where the dP switch activation can be reset by a simple restart of the fuelling \nvehicle. \nIt is important to emphasise that the requirements of JIG1 3.1.4 (c) shall be applied to the control of \nthe dP switch resetting in all cases. The system shall not be capable of being reset by the fuelling \noperator and it shall be installed so that the deadman override or restart of the vehicle does not reset \nand reactivate the system. \nThe action required by this bulletin is a one-off verification of the control and operation of dP switch \nresetting.", "source": "Bulletin-111-Issues-with-DP-switches.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "1", "chunk_length": 1397}}
