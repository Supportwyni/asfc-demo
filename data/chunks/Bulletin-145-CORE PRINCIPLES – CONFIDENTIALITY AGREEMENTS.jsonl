The Agreements have been adjusted where necessary to make a clearer distinction between Joint Ventures and \nOperators. This is helpful in cases where the management of JVs has been outsourced to 3rd Parties. \n2. The definition of \"Core Principles\" has been updated to always include the latest published version instead of \nthe one annexed to the Agreements. \n3. The \"Governing Law\" clause has been amended to allow signatories to choose their legal jurisdiction and \ninclude an Arbitration provision should they wish to do so. \n \nUse of Confidentiality Agreements: \nFollowing this review, there is a new good practice recommendation for Incorporated JVs directly running \noperations is to also complete a Tier 1 Agreement between the Company/Operator and the Users/Throughputters.", "source": "Bulletin-145-CORE PRINCIPLES – CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "1", "chunk_length": 1396}}
