One \nof the potential causes of under-delivery of fuel to an aircraft is fuel bypass via the defuel circuit \nwhere the defuel pipework includes a connection to the fuel delivery pipework downstream of the \nsales meter. \nThe wording of JIG 1 (section 3.1.14) Standard was amended in Issue 11 to clarify this requirement \nand stated that \"a meter by-pass line is not an acceptable design, irrespective of any valve isolation \narrangement\". \nSince the publication of Issue 11 the need for a revision to take account of some fuelling equipment \nused for defuels with meter by-pass lines that cannot be removed has become clear and the \nfollowing amended text to replace section 3.1.14 is applicable with immediate effect. \n3.1.14 \nDelivery pipework \nThe fuelling system shall be designed so that all fuel which passes through the delivery meter is \ndelivered to the aircraft and cannot be diverted elsewhere. This is particularly relevant to fuellers if \nthey are designed to defuel. For new builds a meter by-pass line is not an acceptable design.

For new builds a meter by-pass line is not an acceptable design. For \nexisting vehicles a double valve arrangement with a means of positive confirmation that no fuel is \nbeing diverted to the defuel circuit is acceptable. Any existing non-compliant vehicles shall be \nmodified to meet this requirement or have the defuel circuit drained and permanently disconnected. \nActions required for airport fuelling operations to comply with JIG Standards: \n1. Designate a defuel vehicle or vehicles based on needs and remove and blank off by-pass \npipework from all other fuellers. Care should be taken to avoid low points and dead-legs. \nCompletion before end June 2014 \n2. On designated defuel vehicles, the defuel pipework shall be modified to ensure that no \nfuel can bypass the delivery meter during normal fuelling operations. An example of \nacceptable isolation is a double ball-valve arrangement. \nCompletion before end June 2014 \n3. For designated defuel vehicles with a double valve arrangement in the defuel pipework, \nthe valves shall be tested weekly (by pressurising with the deadman and checking for \nmovement of the delivery meter) to provide assurance that they are not bypassing.
