Had this spray come into contact with a source of ignition \nsuch as a hot aircraft engine or the exhaust system of a nearby vehicle, the outcome could \nhave been an ignition of explosive force with the possibility of multiple fatalities. The event \nwas captured on a CCTV security camera and the image below clearly shows the spray \nwhich engulfed several neighbouring aircraft. \n \n \n \nSince this dramatic incident there have been a number of occasions at airports around the \nworld where a hydrant pit coupler has been struck by a passing vehicle, dislodging the \ncoupler from the pit valve. In a small number of cases this has resulted in a spray of fuel \nsimilar to the Auckland incident, when, for a variety of reasons, the pit valve has failed to \nclose properly. \n \nFortunately none of these fuel releases have ignited, but the potential severity means that \nsuch an event is one of the major accident risk scenarios present at any airport", "source": "Bulletin-40-HydrantPitCouplerIncident-Feb-2011.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "1", "chunk_length": 1398}}

This includes a requirement for a clean break away of the pit \ncoupler from the pit valve when subjected to a sideways impact or load, such as would result \nfrom the pit coupler being struck by a passing vehicle. \nWhen the coupler breaks away cleanly, the pit valve poppet will close rapidly thus minimising \nany jet fuel release. There will still be some spillage from the hydrant dispenser hose and \npipe work via the damaged coupler, but this is significantly less hazardous than a \npressurised geyser of jet fuel from a damaged pit valve. \nCompliance with EI 1584 Third Edition requirements for hydrant pit valves has been the \nsubject of earlier JIG Bulletins and compliance has now been achieved at the majority of JIG \nairport locations. However, the major accident risk barrier which EI 1584 Third Edition \nprovides will not be realised until the pit couplers are also compliant.
