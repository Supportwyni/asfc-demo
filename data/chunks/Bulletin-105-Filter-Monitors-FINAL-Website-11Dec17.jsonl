The \nonly change in the EI 1583 7th edition is the inclusion of a requirement that SAP is not detectable in fuel downstream of a filter \nmonitor element under test during Qualification Test 1 and 10. \nAs no other changes have been made to the qualification testing requirements that were included in the 6th edition, existing \nqualifications to EI 1583 6th edition are recognised as also meeting the requirements of the 7th edition, if the ICP copper \nvalues obtained during both qualification test 1 and 10 were below the lower limit of detection for the method (<= 50 ppb). \nThis read-across from the 6th to 7th editions applies only to the specific model qualified.
