Background \n \n \n \n \nLone Working (or Working alone) refers to situations in which a worker is performing their job duties in isolation \nfrom other workers e.g. they are the only worker present at the workplace or working in a separate room or area, \nwhere assistance is not readily available to the worker in the event of injury, ill health, or emergency. \nExamples of Aviation fuelling operations where lone working may arise could include: \n* \nMechanic working alone in a vehicle service bay. \n* \nOperator or contractor working alone at a depot, hydrant pit valve or ITP facility. \n* \nControl room operator (e.g. at night). \n* \nDriver controlled deliveries (with no other drivers in the area). \n* \nSecurity guard on patrol. \nThe JIG HSSE Management System Standard outlines in Element 2 a requirement to adopt a \"systematic approach to \nhazard identification and risk assessment...\" and that \"the approach shall identify all hazards which have the potential \nto cause harm or damage to people, assets, the environment or reputation, and for which controls shall be developed \nand implemented to reduce the risk to as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP). \n2. Aim \nThe aim of this bulletin is to raise awareness of the hazards and increased risks associated with working alone and to \nprovide", "source": "Bulletin-101-Working-Alone-at-Airports.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "1", "chunk_length": 1399}}

Aim \nThe aim of this bulletin is to raise awareness of the hazards and increased risks associated with working alone and to \nprovide a framework for how sites can approach the management of these risks. Consideration should also be given \nto whether or not lone working is required i.e. can the risk be eliminated by avoiding lone working. \n3. How can risks associated with lone working be managed? \nDevelop a site specific risk assessment for lone working. The risk assessment process detailed below will help identify \nthe hazards from specific lone working situations, assess the risks and identify steps to avoid or control those risks \nwhere necessary: \n3.1 Identify tasks or jobs on site that may lead to people working alone. \nConduct an exercise with site staff to identify possible situations where they may work alone. \n \n3.2 Identify the hazards and possible consequences from those hazards. \nIdentify any possible hazards by examining the nature of the jobs concerned. Take the following into consideration: \na) Identify staff members that may be harmed and what type of injury or ill health may occur. How these \nincidents may occur should also be considered e.g. any health related issues; emergencies (fire etc.), \nequipment failure, etc. \nb) The places, locations, times and environments that are relevant,", "source": "Bulletin-101-Working-Alone-at-Airports.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "1", "chunk_length": 1389}}

The level of supervision should be based on the findings of a risk \nassessment, i.e. the higher the risk, the greater the level of supervision required. It should not be left to \nindividuals to decide whether they need assistance, as this approach may be unsafe. \nb) Where a worker is new to a job, undergoing training, doing a job that presents specific risks, or dealing with \nnew situations, it may be advisable for them to be accompanied when they first take up the post. \n \n3.4.3 Monitoring \nProcedures must be put in place to monitor lone workers as effective means of communication are essential.
