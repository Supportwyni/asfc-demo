This Bulletin seeks to issue \nguidance for users of JIG standards in managing operations under these conditions but also to \nprepare for a return to normal service levels when activity begins to recover. \n \nGuidance is provided to operations where there is either limited or zero airfield operations, for: \n* Maintaining Operations (even if at reduced level), or \n* Decommissioning and Recommissioning of equipment where necessary \n \nOperating sites are advised to follow company guidelines and local legislation, in addition to \nfollowing recommendations included in this Bulletin. JIG will continue to monitor the situation and \nupdate the advice as necessary but at least quarterly.

This is particularly important for operators reducing \ntheir manned hours in case they have a need to be contacted during the new unmanned period. \n \nThe following shall be taken into consideration: \n \n* Maintain sufficient stock in consultation with suppliers and airport authorities. \n* Enhanced surveillance during fuel receipts is required, e.g. confirmation that the quality \ncertificate for the incoming batch is less than 180 days old. \n* Monthly conductivity monitoring of Jet fuel stocks (minimum", "source": "Bulletin-128-Placing equipment into care as part of pandemic response 25Mar20.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "2", "chunk_length": 1396}}
