Bulletin 15 focussed on the dangers arising from co-transport in \nmultiproduct pipelines, particularly surface effects on the pipewall. Bulletin 16 \nhighlighted the dangers of very low level bulk contamination with biodiesel. \n \nJIG Bulletins 15 and 16 are available at www.jointinspectiongroup.org \n \nSince those bulletins were issued, there have been a number of developments and \nthe purpose of this bulletin is to provide an update on progress on this issue. \n \nFirstly, the <5 mg/kg (ppm) limit agreed with the aircraft and engine manufacturers \n(OEMs) has now been incorporated into the DEF STAN specification for Jet A-1 (see \nDEF STAN 91-91 Issue 6 Amendment 1 at www.dstan.mod.uk)\u0001\u0002\n \nSecondly, recognising that the 5 ppm limit will not provide sufficient headroom for \nnormal operations, an industry-funded approval programme has been launched.

Pipeline trials have shown that the bio-component, FAME (Fatty Acid Methyl Ester), \ncan adhere to metal surfaces and be subsequently desorbed by a following jet fuel parcel, \nthus contaminating it with low levels of FAME. Thus, fuel handling operations need to be \ncarefully controlled and measures introduced to ensure that such cross-contamination is \navoided as far as is practicably possible. However, it is recognised by the industry that trace \nlevels of FAME will inevitably find their way into jet fuel and, as its presence in jet fuel is not \napproved by the aircraft engine and airframe manufacturers (OEMs), a programme of work \nis required to demonstrate that the presence of FAME in jet fuel will not compromise aircraft \nsafety nor adversely affect aircraft operation. \n \nTo avoid supply disruption at airports, fuel", "source": "Bulletin-20-EI-FAME-update-Oct08.pdf-Public.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "2", "chunk_length": 1394}}
