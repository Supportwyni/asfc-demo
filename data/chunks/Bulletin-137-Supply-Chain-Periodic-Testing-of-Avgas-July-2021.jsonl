This Bulletin relates to a need to carefully \nmanage those Avgas properties that may deteriorate when kept in tank for extended periods, or where certain \nproduct properties are already close to specification limits which may limit the remaining storage life of the product. \nBackground \nWhen aviation fuels are in storage, they may be subject to changes in their properties and composition over time. \nThe primary mechanisms for these changes are chemical reactions (such as oxidation or polymerisation of the fuel) \nor evaporative loss of the more volatile components within the fuel. Many factors affect this, including the length of \ntime since production, whether the fuel has been stored in over-ground or underground storage tanks, tank size (and \nrelative ullage volume), ambient temperature changes, the effectiveness of pressure / vacuum vents and", "source": "Bulletin-137-Supply-Chain-Periodic-Testing-of-Avgas-July-2021.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "1", "chunk_length": 1397}}

To manage this risk within the supply chain, EI/JIG 1530 \nstipulates that aviation fuel shall have been tested at least 180 days prior to delivery to an airport. \nRecent evidence has shown that this control alone is not robust in preventing some fuels from being delivered to \nairports outside of specification limits: specifically, this is related to evaporative losses in Avgas. In these \ncircumstances, properties of particular concern are the Reid Vapour Pressure (hereafter RVP) and the 10% volume \nrecovery temperature within in the distillation test (hereafter T10). \nAside: \nRVP is a measurement of the pressure at which a given liquid fuel can form a stable vapour forms at a fixed \ntemperature. Light components in a fuel contribute to a higher vapour pressure and the removal of these \nlight components causes the RVP to reduce. Similarly, the T10 temperature will increase with a fuel when \nlight components are lost as the remaining fuel lacks the more volatile elements and this results in a higher", "source": "Bulletin-137-Supply-Chain-Periodic-Testing-of-Avgas-July-2021.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "1", "chunk_length": 1399}}

Work was done to estimate \nhow changes in T10 and RVP and T10 might correlate with changes in density of Avgas, and this has been used to set \nadditional margins above the specification limits for RVP and T10 that would allow 180-day testing at the supply \npoint to continue to be robust without additional action. This is seen as being effective since Control Checks on the \nfuel limit the difference in density to 3 kg/m3 and should identify fuels which have suffered large volatile losses, \nthereby restricting such fuels from being released to, or accepted by, an airport. \nWhen a fuel has RVP and T10 results closer to the specification limits than those which would allow a Control Check \nto be an effective barrier in identifying evaporative losses, then the frequency of testing of RVP and T10 shall be \nincreased at the supplying terminal and is the subject of this Bulletin. \nReference to Previous JIG Bulletins \nThis bulletin shall be read in conjunction with EI/JIG 1530 and is intended to be implemented in addition to the \nrequirement in section 2.2.6 which states: \nAny movement of aviation fuel shall be supported by an RCQ, CoA or RT Certificate that is less than 180 days \nold. \nNote: Drum stocks are exempt from this requirement; here the certification is valid for 12 months from", "source": "Bulletin-137-Supply-Chain-Periodic-Testing-of-Avgas-July-2021.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "2", "chunk_length": 1399}}
