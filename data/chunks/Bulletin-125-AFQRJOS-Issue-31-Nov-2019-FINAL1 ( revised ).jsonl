The Notes highlight some of the main issues concerning the \nspecification parameters. Specifically of note, Issue 31 introduces the following changes: \n* \nInformation included on suitable Fluorescent Indicator Dyed Gel to be used when measuring Aromatic Content by ASTM \nD1319 or IP 156. \n* \nThe change of mandatory requirement for antioxidant in hydroprocessed fuels to an optional requirement in fuel \nmanufactured from petroleum sources (refer to Clause 4 'Materials' in Defence Standard 91-091 and Section 6 \n'Materials and Manufacture' in ASTM D1655).
