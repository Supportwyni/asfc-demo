Confirms the extension of validity of JIG Bulletin 128, until further notice. \n2. Supplements the guidance information provided in JIG Bulletin 128 regarding the \nreturn/recommissioning of equipment or facilities that had been set temporarily out of service \nor decommissioned. \n \nBackground \nOn 25th March 2020, JIG issued Bulletin 128 to offer guidance to users of JIG standards in managing \noperations under the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic but also to prepare for a return to \nnormal service levels when activity begins to recover. \n \nSince the beginning of the pandemic crisis, JIG has been continuously monitoring the situation and \ncommunicating with its members, in order to offer guidance and support a smooth return to \noperations, as the demand for air travel begins to recover and facilities progressively resume \noperations. \n \nOperating sites are reminded that recommendations provided in this Bulletin need to be carefully \nconsidered in conjunction with recommendations and", "source": "Bulletin-131-Resuming-Operations-after-Pandemic-Response.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "1", "chunk_length": 1393}}

Where circulation back to storage \nis not possible, establish an appropriate plan to safely flush at least the \nline content using e.g. vehicles, with due consideration on whether the \nrequired fuel velocity can be achieved etc. \nLow point drains \nEstablish a plan to reinstate the weekly low point flushing procedure, \nwhere required. For hydrant sections that had been isolated from \nservice and had not been subjected to routine flushing, there may be a \nrisk of microbiological growth, therefore enhanced surveillance is \nrecommended. \nTightness Control \nConduct hydrant integrity and pressure testing as required \nCP \nConduct Cathodic Protection (CP) system checks as required. Resume \nCP testing within 3 months, if CP testing has been delayed due to lack \nof availability of the qualified technician \nUnused pits \nIf a hydrant pit has remained unused for more than three months,", "source": "Bulletin-131-Resuming-Operations-after-Pandemic-Response.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "9", "chunk_length": 1142}}
