Issue 13 \nof the JIG Standards also mandate the installation of Dual air/lanyard operated hydrant pit valves by 31st December \n2024 (JIG2 3.5.2). Once a dual air / lanyard pilot is installed, the integrated deadman function of the hydrant pit valve \nbecomes active and this serves as the primary isolation system in the event of an emergency where the hydrant pit \ncoupler is damaged and is operated by releasing the deadman instead of pulling the lanyard. The deadman closing \nfunction of the hydrant pit valve is independently tested during annual dynamic testing of the hydrant pit valve. It is \ncommon practice for the vehicle air supply to be used to supply both the hydrant pit coupler mounted deadman and \nthe hydrant pit pilot valve. However, when performing the deadman system performance test in this configuration, \nthe air is exhausted from both the pilot valve and the coupler mounted deadman simultaneously. Therefore, it is not \npossible to", "source": "Bulletin-146-Independent-Deadman-Testing-141022.cleaned.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "1", "chunk_length": 1391}}

Therefore, it is not \npossible to determine whether the closing time observed is attributable to the closure of the hydrant pit valve or the \nhydrant pit coupler. The opening and closure time of the deadman function of the hydrant pit coupler is adjustable \nwhereas that of the hydrant pit valve is factory set and is non-adjustable. \nThe JIG working group established to study this issue has concluded that the coupler mounted deadman shall be \nperiodically tested independently of the hydrant pit valve closure. Assurance that the hydrant pit coupler operates \nwithin the required limits is particularly important during the transition to dual/air hydrant pit valves where vehicles \nmay be fuelling using both dual air lanyard and lanyard only pit valves for a period of time. Independent testing of the \npit coupler mounted deadman can be efficiently conducted at the same time as quarterly Pressure/surge control \nsystem testing by using one of these 2 suitable options. \na) Installing a Lanyard only operated (manual) hydrant pilot valve at the hydrant test rig location. \nThe perceived risks and consequences of the hydrant pit valve being struck by a vehicle are considerably lower \nat a test rig location compared to an", "source": "Bulletin-146-Independent-Deadman-Testing-141022.cleaned.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "1", "chunk_length": 1393}}
