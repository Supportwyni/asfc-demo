These can be present due to \n* the intentional addition of permitted performance additive materials (such as lubricity \nimprovers, corrosion inhibitors and static dissipator additives (SDA) \n* trace materials from the crude oil that distil in the Jet fuel boiling cut \n* unintended incidental contamination that occurs during fuel distribution especially in multi-\nproduct transportation systems. \nNot all surfactants are a concern, but they need to be controlled in jet fuel as their presence may cause \ndisarming of filtration systems that are designed to coalesce and remove water from onward transfer \nof the fuel. Surfactants can also act to disperse particles (or in extreme cases act as detergents to \nmobilise otherwise stable particles) which can result in fuel that is difficult to settle or filter. \nWater separation property testing of fuel is conducted for two main reasons with jet fuel: \n1.

A high rating suggests a fuel free of harmful surfactants; a low rating indicates that harmful \nsurfactants may be present. The reason that two limits are specified is that the test method (ASTM \nD3948) is sensitive to the presence of an SDA, but the surfactant effects of this additive are not \ndeemed as harmful to operations as they have a negligible impact on both filtration efficiency, \nparticulate mobilisation and settling. \nNo other water separation tests are currently approved for use at the point of manufacture. \n \nTesting downstream of the Point of Manufacture \nBoth primary specifications contain a statement indicating that results from water separation property \ntesting downstream of the point of manufacture are not to be used as the sole reason for rejection of \nfuel, but they can indicate a mandatory need for further diligent investigation.

Due to the potential \nfor unnecessary supply disruption, a protocol for handling failing water separation property (by ASTM \nD3948) results was introduced by JIG initially in Bulletin 14 (2007) and this has been updated by various \nBulletins since that time: Bulletin 65, 121 and 129 (2013, 2019 and 2020), \nRevised status of available testing methods: \nASTM D7224 \nExperience with this method in a small number of circumstances showed sensitivity with some fuels, \nas detailed in Bulletin 121.
