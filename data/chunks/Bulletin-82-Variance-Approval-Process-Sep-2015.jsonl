However, it is recognised that for a limited number of \ncircumstances there are reasons why this is not possible and variations from the JIG \nStandards are necessary. Such variations require documenting and approval by a Variance \nApproval Process. \nSection 1.4.3 of JIG Issue 11 describes the variance approval process for JIG Joint \nVentures. The purpose of this JIG Bulletin is to provide a revised procedure which is \napplicable to all locations which operate to JIG Standards. \n \nVariance Approval Process \nLocations which require specific operational variations to the JIG Standards shall have a \ndocumented Variance Approval Process. Variances shall be unanimously approved by the \nBoard of Directors or Management Committee of the organisation (\"Location Management\") \nwith the approval of each of their organisation's Technical Authority. The \"Technical \nAuthority\" is the office or designated representative providing technical management support \nto the component members of the Location Management. \n \nThe JIG Variance Approval Certificate, shown as an attachment to this bulletin, shall be used \nas described below for approval by Location Management", "source": "Bulletin-82-Variance-Approval-Process-Sep-2015.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "1", "chunk_length": 1399}}
