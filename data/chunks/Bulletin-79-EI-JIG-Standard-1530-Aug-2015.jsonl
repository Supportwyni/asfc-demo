This standard was produced in response to the need, identified by \nMembers of JIG and the wider industry, for comprehensive guidance for adoption by any \ncompany or organisation involved in the manufacturing, testing, blending or handling of \naviation fuel upstream of airports. \nEI/JIG Standard 1530 was developed as a joint EI and JIG Publication to include the existing \ntechnical content of JIG 3 related to upstream storage installations, to update it, and to \nexpand this to include manufacturing, testing and other supply and distribution operations. \nIn addition, EI/JIG 1530 focuses specifically on product quality assurance upstream of \nairports, and has some differences from JIG 3, as outlined below; \n1.
