Surfactants can also lift rust and other solid particulate from surfaces, thus \nincreasing the solids level in the fuel. Surfactants can also act as dispersants, reducing the particle size of \nsuspended solid and water droplets and this can significantly increase time for removal by settling. This \nreduction in particle size can result in solids and water droplets so fine that they pass through filters. \nIn order to help prevent contamination by transmission of solids and water in the manufacture and \ndistribution of Jet Fuel to airports, the elimination or minimization of surfactants that can compromise the \nability of fuel handling systems to remove dirt and water, i.e. harmful surfactants, is an important \nconsideration. \nSurfactants may be contaminants or deliberately added materials.

Both Defence Standard 91-091 and ASTM \nD-1655 (the prime fuel specifications that make up the latest edition of AFQRJOS 'Checklist' Issue 30) require \ntesting of water separation properties by Microseparometer (MSEP by ASTM D3948) and describe test limits \nwith and without the addition of Static Dissipator Additive (SDA). A high rating suggests a fuel free of \nsurfactants; a low rating indicates that harmful surfactants may be present. The reason that two limits are \nspecified is that the test method (ASTM D3948) is sensitive to the presence of SDA, although testing has \nshown that SDA has a negligible impact on both filtration efficiency and settling. \nBoth primary specifications contain a statement indicating that results from MSEP (ASTM D3948) \ndownstream of the point of manufacture are not to be used as the sole reason for rejection of fuel, but they \ncan indicate a mandatory need for further diligent investigation. This statement is based on significant \nhistorical information where failing MSEP (ASTM D3948) results downstream of the manufacturing location \nhave been found to be due to either poor test method precision, or presence of essentially non-harmful \nsurfactants.

It is concluded that thermal stability testing is not \nsufficiently sensitive to the presence of harmful surfactants. \nTesting Developments \nIndustry activity to improve the precision of water separation testing has been ongoing for more than 20 \nyears. The aim has been to improve precision, whilst maintaining a sensitivity to potentially harmful \nsurfactants. Surfactants may be active at very low concentrations (below 1ppm) and this makes the \ndevelopment of new tests more challenging.
