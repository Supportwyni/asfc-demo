The EI 1522 standard was \ndeveloped by the Energy Institute with inputs from JIG member representatives and relevant \nmanufacturers of fuelling hose accessories. \nA variety of hose accessories are on offer to aviation fuelling vehicle suppliers and hose users, \nwhich are intended to be fitted along the length of hoses. These may offer benefits such as \nminimising manual handling risks and increasing hose visibility. Despite this, there remains the \nneed for accessories to not invalidate hose performance characteristics, cause inadvertent \nwear of the outer cover of the hose, contribute to foreign object debris (FOD) or introduce \nflammability or electrostatic hazards. \nThe minimum requirements set out in EI 1522 are intended to assist accessory suppliers/users \nto demonstrate their conformance to this standard and allow purchasers to make a more \ninformed decision when procuring such attachments. \nAccessories include, but are not limited to: \n- \nspiral coils, \n- \nwraps, \n- \nbeads, \n- \ncollars, \n- \nsleeves (including those used for overwing fuelling grade identification), \n-", "source": "Bulletin-120-EI-1522-Fuelling-Hose-Attachments.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "1", "chunk_length": 1392}}

Should non-metallic \nversions be developed in future then they may require testing in accordance with EI 1522. \nCase for action \nUsers should specify EI 1522 specification when ordering fuelling hose accessories, while \nmanufacturers of such items are developing these products or maturing their product offers. \nIt is expected that the next issue of the JIG standards will mandate fuelling hose accessories to \nbe compliant with EI 1522. \nIt is reminded that hose beads and spiral wraps shall be removed before hose pressure testing, \nin accordance with JIG Standards (section A13.2.2).", "source": "Bulletin-120-EI-1522-Fuelling-Hose-Attachments.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "1", "chunk_length": 1057}}
