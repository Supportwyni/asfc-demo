No precision data are available for fuels containing SDA; if MSEP testing is carried out \nduring downstream distribution, no specification limits apply and the results are not to be used as the sole reason \nfor rejection of a fuel.

In such cases, the Certificate of Quality for the batch should be annotated thus: \"Product meets \nthe requirements of AFQRJOS Check List 29 except for electrical conductivity\". In some situations, the conductivity can \ndecrease rapidly and the fuel can fail to respond to additional dosing with Stadis 450. In such cases, fuel may be released \nwith conductivity down to a minimum of 25pS/m provided that the fuel is fully tested against the specification and the \nTank Release Note is annotated with the explanation \"Product released below 50pS/m due to conductivity loss as per \nAnnex H of DEFSTAN 91-091/9\". \n21.
