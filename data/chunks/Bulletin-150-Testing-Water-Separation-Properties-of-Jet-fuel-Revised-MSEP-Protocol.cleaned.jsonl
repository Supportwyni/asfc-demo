Surfactants can also act to disperse particles (or in extreme cases act as detergents to mobilise \notherwise stable particles) which can result in fuel that is difficult to settle or filter. \nWater separation property testing of fuel is conducted for two main reasons with jet fuel: \n1.

Defence Standard \n91-091 also lists D8073 as the alternative method with a limit that applies whether an SDA is present in \nthe fuel or not. At this point in time, ASTM D3948 remains the referee method. A high rating number \nsuggests a fuel free of harmful surfactants; a low rating number indicates that harmful surfactants may be \npresent. The reason that two limits are specified for ASTM D3948 is that the test method (D3948) is \nsensitive to the presence of SDA, but the surfactant effects of this additive are not deemed as harmful to \noperations as they have a negligible impact on both filtration efficiency, particulate mobilisation and settling \nand this has been demonstrated in both filter element qualification testing and empirically in aviation fuel \nhandling over several decades. \n \n \nTesting downstream of the Point of Manufacture \nBoth primary specifications contain a statement indicating that results from water separation property testing \ndownstream of the point of manufacture are not to be used as the sole reason for", "source": "Bulletin-150-Testing-Water-Separation-Properties-of-Jet-fuel-Revised-MSEP-Protocol.cleaned.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "2", "chunk_length": 1399}}

This statement is based on significant \nhistorical information where failing water separation property results (by ASTM D3948) downstream of the \nmanufacturing location have been found to be due to either poor test method precision, or presence of \nsurfactants that do not affect filtration performance. Due to multiple occurrences of unnecessary supply \ndisruption, a protocol for handling failing water separation property (by ASTM D3948) results was introduced \nby JIG initially in Bulletin 14 (2007) and this was updated by various Bulletins since that time: Bulletin 65 \n(2013), 121 (2019), 129 (2020) and 142 (2022). \n \nRevised status of available testing methods \nASTM D3948 \nJIG Bulletin 121 indicated that method ASTM D3948 shall only be used for testing the water separation \nproperty downstream of point of manufacture until the end of May 2020.
