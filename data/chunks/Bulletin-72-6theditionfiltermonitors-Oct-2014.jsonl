A September 2014 \naddendum to EI 1583 6th edition has now been issued by the Energy Institute. This \naddendum clarifies certain laboratory testing requirements, rather than introduces any \ntechnical changes, and therefore does not require any existing EI 1583 6th edition filter \nmonitor models to be re-qualified. \n2\" Filter Monitor Elements qualified to the 6th edition of EI 1583 have been available since \n2011 and were required to be used in JIG Joint Ventures before the end of December 2012. \n6\" Filter Monitor Elements of both out-to-in and in-to-out flow configurations qualified to the \n6th edition of EI 1583 are now available from a number of manufacturers. Both JIG and IATA \nare supportive of the use of 6th edition elements as soon as possible. \n \nThe use of monitor elements requires that a number of conditions shall be in place: \n \nMonitor elements shall not be used where the fuel contains fuel system icing inhibitor (FSII). \n \nA filter monitor should be operated as closely as possible to its", "source": "Bulletin-72-6theditionfiltermonitors-Oct-2014.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "1", "chunk_length": 1394}}
