There is also an ISO specification, ISO 1825:2010 which has \nrecently been updated so that its content is essentially identical to EN 1361. The intention is that EN \n1361 shall now be withdrawn. The purpose of this technical bulletin is to make users aware of the \ndifferent specifications and also to highlight some user information. These details will be included in \nJIG Guidelines Issue 11 which will be published later this year. \n \n \nAircraft Fuelling Hose Specifications \n \nAircraft fuelling hoses shall be qualified to one or more of the following specifications and all new \naircraft fuelling hoses shall be manufactured in accordance with the requirements of EI 1529: \n \nEN 1361:2004 Rubber hoses and hose assemblies for aviation fuel handling: Specification \nThis specification was first published in 1997 and superseded BS 3158.
