Stan 91-91 and ASTM D-1655. \n \nWhere the product is within facilities operated to JIG Standards, the following investigation protocol \nshould be adopted in the event of a low MSEP result (or low average of results), i.e., less than 70, but \ngreater than 50, has been obtained on recertification testing of Jet Fuel containing Static Dissipater \nAdditive (SDA) or less than 85, but greater than 50, on recertification testing of Jet Fuel not containing \nSDA at an intermediate storage location downstream of the point of manufacture. \n \nThe purpose of this MSEP protocol is to avoid a supply disruption based on an MSEP failure alone. \nThe protocol takes into account the poor repeatability of the test method (ASTM D3948) as it is \ncurrently specified, together with the knowledge gained from experience that low MSEP values do not \nnecessarily indicate a problem with the fuel, either with contamination or water separation. For \nexample, a result of 70 has a reproducibility of +/- 20. \n \nDespite", "source": "Bulletin-65-MSEPProtocol-Jun2013.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "1", "chunk_length": 1395}}

For \nexample, a result of 70 has a reproducibility of +/- 20. \n \nDespite this poor repeatability/reproducibility, JIG remains supportive of the use of MSEP testing \ndownstream of the point of manufacture, when appropriate, because it can give an indication of \ncontamination that would otherwise remain undetected. Low level metal/ surfactant contaminants \nalso can decrease MSEP results and have the potential to deteriorate thermal oxidative stability \n(ASTM D3241/IP323). This protocol provides a procedure for interpreting and evaluating the \nsignificance of low MSEP results. Depending on the initial duplicate results, further sampling and \ntesting of MSEP and thermal oxidative stability test testing will be conducted to determine a batch's \nsuitability for onward shipment. Since strong surfactants can allow free water to pass through filter \nwater separators, MSEP results of 49 and below will require an investigation by the relevant \nQC/Technical Authority prior to release. \n \nNew test methods are being developed under the auspices of the UK Energy Institute and ASTM \nand these will hopefully become available in the next few years.
