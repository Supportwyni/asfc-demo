The precautions outlined below are applicable to locations that supply only\nJet Fuel, or only Avgas, in addition to those locations which supply both grades. \nThis Bulletin is issued as an update to existing JIG procedures for overwing fuelling (JIG 1 -\nInto-Plane Fuelling Services, Section 6.5.5 and Appendix A4) and is intended to reflect current \nindustry best practice in the prevention of misfuelling incidents. Misfuelling is the term used to \ndescribe when the incorrect grade of fuel is delivered to an aircraft. A misfuelling could result in\nan aircraft engine failure and this could be catastrophic if it occurs during flight. It is essential\nthat procedures are in place to prevent this possibility.\nSimilar Aircraft \nCertain aircraft are particularly vulnerable to misfuelling as they are similar looking but have \ndifferent fuel requirements. Some examples are: \nRequires Avgas\nRequires Jet Fuel\nBeechcraft Queen Air \nlooks like\nBeechcraft King Air \nCessna 404 Titan\nlooks like\nCessna 441 Conquest \nIn some cases, manufacturers supply the same aircraft with either Avgas or Jet Fuel powered\nengines.

Where orders for fuel are received verbally in person or by telephone, the order,\nincluding the required grade, should be repeated to the customer and the quantity and grade \nrecorded in writing.\nConfirmation of the required grade shall always be made before fuelling commences by \nchecking that the grade markings adjacent to the aircraft filling point and on the fuelling\nequipment are the same as the fuel grade requested. If no grade markings are present on the\naircraft or if the grade markings are unclear, the pilot or responsible ground servicing personnel \nshall reconfirm the grade required by completing a Fuel Grade Confirmation Form. An example\nof a suitable form is shown on page 4 of this Bulletin.\nPage 1 of 5 \n www.jointinspectiongroup.org", "source": "Bulletin-27-Misfuelling-Aug-09.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "1", "chunk_length": 1108}}

Where the use of a smaller non-\nselective Jet Fuel spout is necessary, additional controls are required.\nNon-selective Jet Fuel spouts \nAt locations where it is occasionally necessary to use a small Jet Fuel spout it is strongly\nrecommended that the overwing nozzle stowage shall be designed such that the interlock is \ndisengaged only when the selective spout is fitted. This is to ensure that the selective spout is\nre-attached to the nozzle after any fuelling operation with the smaller spout.\nAn example of suitable interlock stowage is shown below: \nAdditionally, the Fuel Grade Confirmation form should be signed by the fuelling operator to\nconfirm that the grade selective spout was reattached to the nozzle after completion of fuelling. \nAt some locations, for example where there are many fuellings of light aircraft and helicopters\nwith small filling orifices, the routine", "source": "Bulletin-27-Misfuelling-Aug-09.pdf", "meta": {"page_span": "2", "chunk_length": 1399}}
